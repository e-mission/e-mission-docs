## Overview: ##
e-mission is an open-source, extensible platform for instrumenting human travel
data. By understanding where, when, how and why people travel, we can, at a
personal level, nudge people towards sustainable modes of transportation, and
at a structural level, plan our urban areas better.

There are three main areas where we need to improve the system going forward. While it is possible to file issues for each of them, having one overview document with all the research links makes it easier to get an overall picture of what needs to be done.
